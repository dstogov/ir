?  Passing and returning stuctures by value
	+ in memory
	- in several registers
	- full ABI conformance
-  MEMCPY, MEMSET
-  Consider IR cleanup (VAR -> ALLOCA, VLOAD -> LOAD, VSTORE -> STORE, LOOP_END -> END, LOOP_BEGIN -> MERGE, PI)
-  long constants
-  long double

-  revisit ir_bind()

?  reassociation folding rules
-  folding engine improvement (one rule for few patterns)

-  Extend SCCP to support range inference and PI node
	- See "Eliminating Range Checks using SSA Form" John Gough, Herbert Klaeren
	- PI nodes may be defined as %dst = BOUND_LOW/HIGH(%ctrl, %src, %low/high_bound)
	- PI nodes may be inserted after IF and GUARD
	- PI should not be lifted to BB with PHIs

?  instruction selection
	- btsl=INCL, btrl=EXCL, btl=IN, bsr
    - MOVZX to avoid a SHIFT and AND instruction
    - BURS ???

?  register allocation
	-  optimisation of spill code placement (BB local or through resolution)
	-  separate INT and FP allocation phases (for performance)
	-  Try to avoid live-interval construction, see "Efficient Global Register Allocation" Ian Rogers

?  code generation
	-  TAILCALL with stack arguments (tests/x86/tailcall_001.itr)
	-  32-bit x86 back-end 64-bit integers support
		(add_009.irt, conv_001.irt, conv_002.irt, conv_004.irt, conv_010.irt, sub_009.irt)
	-  binary code emission without DynAsm ???

?  modules (functions, data objecs, import, export, prototypes, forward declarations, memory segments, ref data, expr data) 
-  interpreter
-  alias analyzes
